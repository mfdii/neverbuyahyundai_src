      Many Hyundai models, over many model years, have been plagued with problems including engine failure. These problems were only published as a "Service Campaign",
      meaning the problem will not show on a recall report and there is zero obligation for a car reseller to fix the underlying problems. You'll only discover the problem
      when your Hyundai shows a flashing Check Engine light (Code P1326) and goes into limp mode.
      No matter how much Hyundai claims you're covered with "Hyundai Assurance", the most assuring warranty is one you never need to use.

    title: Hundred of thousands high mileage used Hyundais on the market today are waiting to breakdown.
    subtitle: >
      Used Hyundai vehicles are just waiting to breakdown due to Hyundai's poor engineering practices, and years of selling cars with known engine problems. 
      There have been class action lawsuits that have resulted in a 15yr/150,000 miles extended warranty from Hyundai. But many of the cars covered
      by this extended warranty have already reached, or are fast appraoching, the warranty expiration. Seeing that a new engine
      starts at $7,000 from Hyundai, it's important to know if your vehicle is impacted. See the list of impacted vehicles & engines here.

    title: What can you do?
    subtitle: >
      Hyundai has worked tirelessly to avoid admitting guilt in the class action lawsuit, even though
      they purposefully sold and marketed cars that had a known problem that leads to costly engine failure and possible fire.

    - title: NEVER Buy a Used or New Hyundai
      text: >
        * **Used Hyundais** - It's not a matter of IF, it's a matter of WHEN these engines will fail. There are numerous cases where 
        Hyundai failed to honor the extended warranty as a way to avoid paying for new engines.

        * **New Hyundais** - While Hyundai offers "Hyundai Assurance" on all new vehicles, do you really want to do business with a company
        that continued to produce, market, & sell faulty vehicles? Many of these failed engines have caught fire when failing.
        Is it worth putting you and your family's lives at risk for "the industry's best warranty"?
    - title: Sell Your Hyundai
      text: >
        If you're close to the 15yr/150,000 mile extended warranty expiration, get out of the vehicle as soon as possible.
        This is espcially important if you have a loan on a used car that could fail and leave you with no car and a loan due.
        A new engine from Hyundai starts at $7000.
    - title: Tell Your Family & Frineds
      text: >
        If you know someone who owns a Hyundai, share with them this site and the relevant service bulletin so they can
        plan a way out of their current Hyundai vehicle.
